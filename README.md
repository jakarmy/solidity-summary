# The Solidity Summary Book
A summary of Solidity programming language.

### Why this summary?
This summary was based on EatTheBlocks YouTube tutorial on Solidity.
While that is a great resource, here's a quick summary of the main points covered across hours of video content.
This summary cuts to the chase. üòâ

## How should I install this?

1. Just clone or download the repository.
2. Open folder with VS Code or similar (there're many Solidity add-ons available).
3. You can also copy/paste the code into [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) and try out the code on the test net.


## Keep in mind
* This tutorial was written with Solidity v0.8.7, a higher version from the original ETB tutorial that uses v0.5.11.
* It's possible that some files throw errors when compiling. This is intentional since there's probably something in that file meant to teach you something can't / shoudn't be done üôÇ.
